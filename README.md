We were not sure whether to include the node_modules folder in the submission, as that was a requirement for the Lab8 submission, so we have included it just in case. When you run this program using the submitted node_modules folder, you are at risk of getting any viruses that may have been on the computer of the one who installed it, so it is recommended that you delete it, and run npm install before running the program

In addition, it's possible there are binary files that are in node_modules that are installed specifically for the architecture of the machine that comitted the changes, so deleting the folder and reinstalling it, as mentioned before, is recommended.

To run the test, run testRunner1.html
To run the main website, type node googleImagesProjectServer.js in the terminal, then run googleImagesProject.html. this is assuming you have node.js installed
